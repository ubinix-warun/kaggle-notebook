Doctors (rather than your model) will make the final decision about when to release each patient; but they hope your model will highlight issues the doctors should consider when releasing a patient.\n\nThe hospital has given you relevant patient medical information.  Here is a list of columns in the data:\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/hospital-readmissions/train.csv')\ndata.columns","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here are some quick hints at interpreting the field names:\n\n- Your prediction target is `readmitted`\n- Columns with the word `diag` indicate the diagnostic code of the illness or illnesses the patient was admitted with. For example, `diag_1_428` means the doctor said their first illness diagnosis is number \"428\".  What illness does 428 correspond to? You could look it up in a codebook, but without more medical background it wouldn't mean anything to you anyway.\n- A column names like `glimepiride_No` mean the patient did not have the medicine `glimepiride`. If this feature had a value of False, then the patient did take the drug `glimepiride`\n- Features whose names begin with `medical_specialty` describe the specialty of the doctor seeing the patient. The values in these fields are all `True` or `False`.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Your Code Library\nAs you write code to work through this scenario, these code snippets from previous tutorials may be useful.
